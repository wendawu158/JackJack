## What is Blackjack?
Blackjack is a card game where you, the player, play against the dealer.

The game begins with you putting down your "stake".

The dealer then deals two cards to you, and two cards to themself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face down, all others are dealt face up.

A hand's total is calculated by adding up the values on the card. Face cards count as ten. Aces count as 11 if the other cards add up to 10 or less, and 1 otherwise.

The goal is to have a higher hand total than the dealer, while having your hand total being 21 or lower.

If you go over 21 or the dealer gets a higher total and stays under 21, you lose, and your stake is forfeited.

If you have the same hand total, you draw, and your stake is returned to you.

Otherwise, you win, and your stake is doubled.
